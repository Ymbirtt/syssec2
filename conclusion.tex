We believe the underlying architecture of networking is worth understanding, as many of the mechanisms were not
designed with security in mind and so the fixes for them are `bolted-on'. Proper configuration and monitoring
of networks is crucial to avoid attacks. It is not hard, for example, to prevent ICMP redirect problems on
modern linux hosts\cite{sysctl}, but this is often not the default setup.

For the Cross-site scripting attacks, a similar theme is apparent; security has been mostly added after the fact.
Whilst the attacks are entirely preventable, they typically require active prevention. Unfortunately many users
are not still sufficiently aware of the danger to know to take those precautions.
