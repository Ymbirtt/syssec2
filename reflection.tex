\subsection{TCP \& IP Attacks}

Many of the attacks in this lab take advantage of old, or bad, default configurations for network stacks. Even the
SYN-FLOOD task description explains the countermeasures you must disable for the attack to have any effect at all. ICMP
redirection is largely preventable with nothing more than proper configuration\cite{sysctl}.
ARP poisoning is easily detectable as well, with tools such as Snort freely available\cite{snort}\cite{snort_arp}.

\subsection{XSS Attacks}

Attacks such as XSS are easily mitigated\cite{cheatsheet}, and are largely found in badly maintained, old or poorly
written web sites and applications. If they are not mitigated, however, then relying on measures such as sandboxing or
client-side security is not always feasible. XSS exploits the trust a user's browser has in the website it is viewing,
and the more powerful the javascript engines and browsers become, the more essential it is that websites are
trustworthy. Various popular internet forums take countermeasures of varying levels of sophistication against attempts
at XSS attacks -- some forums have scripts running which immediately ban users for posting replies containing
anything that might be used for code injection whilst others replace such symbols with amusing strings of text. Indeed,
the attack itself contains code that can be used to prevent it -- calling the {\tt escape()} function over any strings
that are submitted to the server will replace unsafe characters such as {\tt <} with escaped variants, which cannot be
used to inject code into a web page.
