\subsection{TCP \& IP Attacks}
Many of the attacks in this lab take advantage of old, or bad, default configurations for network stacks.
Even the SYN-FLOOD task description explains the countermeasures you must disable for the attack to have any effect at
all. ICMP redirection is easily preventable and detectable. ARP poisoning is easily detectable as well.

\subsection{XSS Attacks}
Attacks such as XSS are easily mitigated,\cite{cheatsheet} and are largely found in badly maintained, old or poorly written web sites
and applications.
