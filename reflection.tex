\subsection{TCP \& IP Attacks}

Many of the attacks in this lab take advantage of old, or bad, default configurations for network stacks. Even the
SYN-FLOOD task description explains the countermeasures you must disable for the attack to have any effect at all. ICMP
redirection is largely preventable with nothing more than proper configuration\cite{sysctl}.
ARP poisoning is easily detectable as well, with tools such as Snort freely available\cite{snort}\cite{snort_arp}.

\subsection{XSS Attacks}

Attacks such as XSS are easily mitigated\cite{cheatsheet}, and are largely found in badly maintained, old or poorly
written web sites and applications. If they are not mitigated, however, then relying on measures such as sandboxing or
client-side security is not always feasible. XSS exploits the trust a user's browser has in the website it is viewing,
and the more powerful the javascript engines and browsers become, the more essential it is that websites are
trustworthy.
